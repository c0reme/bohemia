We at Bohemia are proud of our long history of launching games from our various in-house development studios across the UK.

# Footnote
We are 2nd year students studying at CCCU tasked to improve the existing database model and structure for the given scenario.

<h1>Scenario</h1>
<p>The UK-based games publisher Bohemia has a proud and long history of launching games created by their portfolio of in-house development studios. After a period of rapid growth and their recent acquisition of Ego Applications, executives at Bohemia have outgrown their existing approach for managing organizational data that relied upon local spreadsheets and other local data stores. Bohemia have determined that they need a new cloud-based Enterprise ResourcePlanning (ERP) database to store information about how their organization functions.

There is a critical need to securely record historical and live data about the complex relationships held between the games development studios, their individual projects, and employees.

You work for Olympus Tech, an IT consultancy that specializes in IT infrastructure and data management strategy. The team that you work within focuses on modelling organizational data and have been hired by Bohemia to provide them with a robust solution for their newly proposed centralized database.

Specifically; your team have been assigned the task of creating a back-end database that has the capacity to meet all of the requirements requested by Bohemia and their representatives.</p>
